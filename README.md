# doorbell_clientserver
Hear your doorbell (with wagner hammer) on every computer (no raspberry or arduino needed!)

Client is written for Windows 7, but should work with other versions too. Server is written for (MX) linux.

You have no raspberry or arduino but need to digitalize your door-bell with wagner hammer? No problem, just grab the electronics of an old mouse with usb-port (ps/2 might work as well), solder 2 wires on your mouse-buttonkey (I choose the right).
